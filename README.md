# PoC .NET Blockchain

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept (PoC) blockchain implementation using .NET. It aims to provide a foundational understanding of blockchain principles such as blocks, transactions, consensus mechanisms, and proof-of-work (PoW), implemented in C#.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **.NET SDK**: Install the latest version of the .NET SDK from [Microsoft .NET Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- **Visual Studio** (optional): Recommended for development. Install from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- **Git**: Version control system. Download from [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/poc-dotnet-blockchain.git
   cd poc-dotnet-blockchain
   ```

2. Restore the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### Example Usage

After running the application, you can:

- Create new blocks and add them to the blockchain.
- Simulate transactions.
- Test the proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

The console output will demonstrate blockchain functionality, including block creation, validation, and chain integrity checks.
